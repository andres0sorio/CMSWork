* directories:
doc: documentation (doxygen)
interfaces: interfaces declaration
src: source
exe: executables + testfiles

* Compilation

To compile this code, make sure you hve ROOT installed and its environment set. On lxplus, you can set it up by issuing
the command "cmsenv". This version of the emulator doesn't need ROOT but I wanted to have it in hand (or at least some sort
of framework behind).

From there it is pretty easy: 
% cd src
% make

* Running:

% cd exe
% ./emulate testdata-2.txt TestLogic


Where testdata-2.txt is some data and TestLogic is the selected Logic.

* Documentation

You need to have Doxygen and Graphviz installed

% cd doc
% doxygen config
