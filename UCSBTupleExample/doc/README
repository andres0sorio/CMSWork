Creating the doxygen documentation for this software:

* make sure you have doxygen installed
* if possible, have also the additional package: Graphviz package

Now on the prompt just simply type:

% doxygen config

"config" has the defaults for producing the documentation (you can edit it if you want some further improvement)
